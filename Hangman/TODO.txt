App needs to do: 

	1. pick a word and inform the player how long the word is
	2. allow the player to guess a letter
	3. evaluate the player's guess
		3a. if the guess is correct, show the guess's placement within the word
		3b. otherwise, increase "error count" value
	4. check if the game is finished
		4a. if all of the letters have been guessed, then the player wins!
		4b. if the error count gets higher than a set value, then the player loses
	5. if the game is not finished, loop back to step 2

Stretch goals:
	- player can adjust difficulty to increase word length/decrease error count max value, etc
	- pick category for word
	+ remove guess from list of available guesses
